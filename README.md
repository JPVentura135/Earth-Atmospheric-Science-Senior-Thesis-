    I've constructed a jupyter notebook of the analysis I've done in the Python language. Jupyter notebooks are an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more. 

    To view and interact with the notebook, downloading the anaconda python distribution is recommended. It is an assembly of python function libraries relevant to many scientific fields and beyond. The download which can be found [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos) also contains an automatic installation of the python language and the jupyter notebook software. Be sure to follow the download link for the latest Python version, which is currently Python 3.7. Any feedback , considerations, comments, collaboration is most welcome.
