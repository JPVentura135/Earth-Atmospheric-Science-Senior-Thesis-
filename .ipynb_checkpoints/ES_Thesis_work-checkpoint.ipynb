    "In the first order discussion about the habitability of an environment or planet, temperature is the paramount quantity to investigate. This is because, under the current description of planetary habitability, a temperature regime which supports liquid water is understood to be a necessary requirement for the potential for life. For a terrestrial analog, temperature via stellar flux and surface water content will determine the exposed surface land fraction, which influences planetary surface weathering behavior. This is parameter is important because the silicate-weathering feedback, which is governed by this land fraction, determines the width of the habitability zone in both space and time. This feedback mechanism serves as a control on atmospheric carbon over geologic timescales (>Myr) and is characterized by the dissolution of atmospheric carbon in precipitation and subsequent uptake in exposed silicate rock via chemical reaction between carbonic acid in the rainwater and minerals in the silicate. Furthermore, in addition to stellar flux and distance from the host star, surface and geologic effects on the planetary body are of crucial importance in determining the suitability for life based on their effect on surface temperature.\n",

    "The habitable zone (HZ) is traditionally defined as the region around a star where liquid water can exist in stable phase at the surface of a planet. (Kasting et al 1993). Since climate systems include both positive and negative feedbacks which also define the planetary surface temperature, a planets surface temperature is non-trivially related to potential habitability. The inner orbital distances of the HZ are defined as the \"moist greenhouse\" region, characterized by the planet becoming hot enough (surface temperature ~340K) that large amounts of water can be lost by photolysis in the stratosphere and subsequent hydrogen escape to space. The outer edge of the zone is set where CO2 reaches a high enough pressure that it can no longer provide warming, either because of increased Rayleigh scattering or because it condenses at the surface, which then results in permanent global glaciation. These limits, however, do not represent strict barriers to all types of life. For example, on Earth, life survived glaciations that may have been global, a period known as \"snowball earth\" ocurring 600-700 million years ago. (kirschvink 1992;Hoffman et al, 1998.) ... In all, to begin to be able to interpret the sensitivities provided by climate feedbacks, a model of steady-state planetary energy balance must be employed."

To calculate 3.), we treat Earth as a blackbody (although this is of course an approximation not considering that the atmosphere radiates better at some wavelength than others because of the thermal and optical opacity of gases like H20 and CO2). We start by defining $T_{eff}$, the effective radiating temperature of the planet or the energy that a true blackbody would need to radiate the amount of energy that earth does.\n",
